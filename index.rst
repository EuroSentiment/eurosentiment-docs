Welcome to EUROSENTIMENT's documentation!
=========================================

The aim of the |EUROSENTIMENT|_ project is to create a multilingual Language Resource Pool (LRP) that fosters Sentiment Analysis.
The LRP is available through the |PORTAL|_, and the  `demonstrator`_ gives an overview of the project and its features.

This is the reference documentation for the Language Resource Pool and its services, as well as the API to access other information
